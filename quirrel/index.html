    <h1>&emsp; Quirrel is the apprentice of Monomon the Teacher, one of the three dreamers. To make her own seal even stronger, Monomon gave Quirrel her dreamer mask, and let him wander outside of Hallownest. Upon hearing the call of the Radiance, he returns to Hallownest with a harmed mind, hardly remembering anything of his past in this Kingdom.</h1>
